  <p class="column">Barksley and Cletus are two high-energy bundles of love who are ready to devote themselves
    to a family that loves life as much as they do. Their favorite activities are walks, runs, jogs,
    races, sprints, swims, and cuddles. If you are looking for a pair of friends to share everything with,

  <p class="column">Kaiju is a recent addition to our family here at the shelter, and is a distinguished gentleman
    who appreciates the value of a good nap in the sun as much as the need to put on a show for visitors. As frilled
    lizards are outside the norm for the friends we care for at the shelter, be sure you are well-informed of their needs
    before looking to adopt. <a href="http://www.example.com/">Here</a> is a useful link to various resources useful to 
    someone interested in getting a new scaly friend.
